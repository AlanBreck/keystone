# Images and Files

Keystone [field types](../apis/fields) contain both the `image` and `file`. These two field types can be used to reference, and if required, serve Images and/or Files from Keystone. These field types can be backed by either local or [Amazon S3 storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

## Storage Options - S3 and Local

Getting started with Images and Files in Keystone requires you first create a `storage` object in your Keystone configuration file. Any number of stores can be setup within the `storage` object, and you can mix and match between `local` and `s3` depending on your use case.

The `storage` object defines how and where the assets are stored and accessed by both Keystone and the client frontend. This object defines:

- The `kind` of storage being used - either `s3` or `local`
- The `type` of `field` the storage is being used for - either `file` or `image`
- A function to generate the URL (`generateUrl`) that Keystone returns in the GraphQL API pointing to the location or the storage where the assets can be accessed
- The actual location where Keystone stores the assets - either a local `path` or `s3` bucket details
- The location Keystone will serve the assets from - either a `serverRoute` for `local` or a `proxied` connection for `s3`. Both of these options add a route to Keystone backend which the files can be accessed from

### Defining `storage` in Keystone config

First we are going to use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to retrieve the S3 bucket and URL details from a `.env` file or from set environment varibles.

In your Keystone Config file...

```typescript{24-54}
import { config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { lists } from './schema';

dotenv.config();

 const {
   // The S3 Bucket Name used to store assets
   S3_BUCKET_NAME: bucketName = 'keystone-test',
   // The region of the S3 bucket
   S3_REGION: region = 'ap-southeast-2',
   // The Access Key ID and Secret that has read/write access to the S3 bucket
   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: accessKeyId = 'keystone',
   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secretAccessKey = 'keystone',
   // The base URL to serve assets from
   ASSET_BASE_URL: baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000,
 } = process.env;
/** ... */
```

!> The above pulls the environment varibles and maps them to friendly name to use below

### Storing your assets in `s3`

We can then add an `s3` `storage` object, the object below is called `my_s3_files` and this is the name that we will use in our `field` config later. This can be called any name that makes sense to your use case.

In the [config](../apis/config) object in your `keystone.ts` file...

```typescript
/** config */
storage: {
    my_s3_files: {
      // Files that use this store will be stored in an s3 bucket
      kind: 's3',
      // This store is used for the file field type
      type: 'file',
      // The S3 bucket name pulled from the S3_BUCKET_NAME environment variable above
      bucketName,
      // The S3 bucket region pulled from the S3_REGION environment variable above
      region,
      // The S3 Access Key ID pulled from the S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variable above
      accessKeyId,
      // The S3 Secret pulled from the S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable above
      secretAccessKey
      // The S3 links will be signed so they remain private
      signed: { expiry: 5000 },
    },
    /** more storage */
},
```

### Storing assets on your `local` disk

Assests can also be stored on the `local` disk. The obejct below is called `my_local_images` and is stored in `/public/images` and will be served by Keystone at `/images`.

```typescript
/** config */
storage: {
    my_local_images: {
      // Images that use this store will be stored on the local machine
      kind: 'local',
      // This store is used for the image field type
      type: 'image',
      // The URL that is returned in the Keystone GraphQL API
      generateUrl: path => `${baseUrl}/images${path}`,
      // The route that will be created in Keystone's backend to serve the images
      serverRoute: {
        path: '/images',
      },
      // Set serverRoute to null if you don't want a route to be created in Keystone
      // serverRoute: null
      storagePath: 'public/images',
    },
    /** more storage */
}
```

### Customise the URL returned in GraphQL - `generateUrl`

When using an `image` for `file` field type Keystone returns the following in your GraphQL API query:

```
image {
    id
    filesize
    width
    height
    extension
    ref
    url
}
```

The URL returned in this query is configurable by using the `generateUrl` function. This function takes the `path` which is the full filename and extension and will return the URL you want in the GraphQL API.

### Putting it all together in your Keystone `config`

The below defines two asset stores, one `s3` to store files and one `local` to store images.

```typescript{28-59}
// keystone.ts

import { config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { lists } from './schema';

// We are going to use dotenv to get our variables from a .env file or from set environment variables
dotenv.config();

 const {
   // The S3 Bucket Name used to store assets
   S3_BUCKET_NAME: bucketName = 'keystone-test',
   // The region of the S3 bucket
   S3_REGION: region = 'ap-southeast-2',
   // The Access Key ID and Secret that has read/write access to the S3 bucket
   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: accessKeyId = 'keystone',
   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secretAccessKey = 'keystone',
   // The base URL to serve assets from
   ASSET_BASE_URL: baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000,
 } = process.env;

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'file:./keystone-example.db',
  },
  lists,
  storage: {
    // The key here will be what is referenced in the image field
    my_local_images: {
      // Images that use this store will be stored on the local machine
      kind: 'local',
      // This store is used for the image field type
      type: 'image',
      // The URL that is returned in the Keystone GraphQL API
      generateUrl: path => `${baseUrl}/images${path}`,
      // The route that will be created in Keystone's backend to serve the images
      serverRoute: {
        path: '/images',
      },
      storagePath: 'public/images',
    },
    // The key here will be what is referenced in the file field
    my_s3_files: {
      // Files that use this store will be stored in an s3 bucket
      kind: 's3',
      // This store is used for the file field type
      type: 'file',
      // The S3 bucket name pulled from the S3_BUCKET_NAME environment variable above
      bucketName,
      // The S3 bucket region pulled from the S3_REGION environment variable above
      region,
      // The S3 Access Key ID pulled from the S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variable above
      accessKeyId,
      // The S3 Secret pulled from the S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable above
      secretAccessKey
      // The S3 links will be signed so they remain private
      signed: { expiry: 5000 },
    },
  },
});
```

!> You can define as many stores as required for your use case

## Field types - `image` and `file`

Once you have your `storage` configuration in Keystone you can then use the `image` and `file` [field types](../apis/fields).

Within an existing [list](../apis/schema) use the `image` of `file` field as follows:

```typescript
lists: {
    user: list({
        fields: {
            /** other fields */
            avatar: image({ storage: 'my_local_images' }),
            someFile: file({ storage: 'my_s3_files' }),
        }
    })
}
```

!> The `storage` name here relates to the `storage` defined in your `keystone.ts`

## Relationships - ie Image Gallery

If you want your images (and files) to be reused and accessible across multiple difference lists or in a [Document Field](./document-fields). You can setup a Gallery list and use relationships to reference this.

For example you might have a schema that looks like this:

```typescript
// schema.ts
import { list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text, image } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export const lists = {
    Image: list({
        fields: {
		    name: text({
			    validation: {
				    isRequired: true,
			    },
		    }),
		    altText: text(),
		    image: image({ storage: 'my_local_images' }),
        }
    }),
    Page: list({
        fields: {
            name: text(),
            context: text(),
            images: relationship({ ref: 'Image', many: true })
        }
    })
};
```
